# Portfolio
Hello everyone, I am a current learning developer studying computer science at the the Florida Atlantic University Honors College. I specialize 
in web development, where I have trained to use technologies such as HTML5, CSS, including the Boostrap framework, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub. In this repository, you will find a few projects in development at the moment, such as my personal portfolio, and a project dedicated to building a login page utilizing JavaScript.
